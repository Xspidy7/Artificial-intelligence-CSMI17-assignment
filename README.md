**CSMI17 – Artificial Intelligence Assignment**

Write Prolog programs to complete the following questions:

1. A popular children’s riddle is “Brothers and sisters have I none, but that man’s father is 
my father’s son.” Use the rules of the family domain (Section 8.3.2 on page 301 in the 
Textbook) to find who that man is using a Prolog program.

3. A man, a woman and two children had to go to the opposite bank of a river using a boat. 
The man and the woman weighed 80 kg each and the children weighed 30 kg each. 
Given that the boat can carry upto 100 kg and that everyone can drive a boat, write a 
Prolog program to find how all four can cross the river with the boat. You may refer to
